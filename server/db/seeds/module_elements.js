It can also help create solid backends with platforms like Nodejs, runs desktop applications like Slack, Atom, and Spotify, and runs on mobile phones as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). \n In short, it is everywhere—and for good reasons. For starters, compared to other languages like C and Java, JavaScript is generally easier to learn. When we say ‘easier’, we mean in terms of how quickly you can go from being a JavaScript novice to someone who can actually make a living writing professional, high quality JavaScript code. So, in that sense, it’s more accessible than some other languages like C and Java. \n JavaScript is also a fun and rewarding language, which is especially important when you’re just getting started in software development. The community support is very good, so if you get stuck, there’s a good chance that the problem and its solution already exist on the web.", order_num: 2 },

C++ adds many new features to the C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a superset of C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in C++). C++’s claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language. As for what an object is and how it differs from traditional programming methods, well, we’ll cover that in chapter 8 (Basic object-oriented programming). \n C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee (this means the ISO committee ratified a document describing the C++ language, to help ensure all compilers adhered to the same set of standards). A minor update was released in 2003 (called C++03). \n Three major updates to the C++ language (C++11, C++14, and C++17, ratified in 2011, 2014, and 2017 accordingly) have been made since then, each adding additional functionality. C++11 in particular added a huge number of new capabilities, and at this point is widely considered the new baseline. As of the time of writing, C++20 is in the works, promising to bring even more new capabilities. Future upgrades to the language are expected every three or so years. /n Each new formal release of the language is called a language standard (or language specification). Standards are named after the year they are released in. For example, there is no C++15, because there was no new standard in 2015.", order_num: 3 },
